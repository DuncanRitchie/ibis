# My Index of Birds I’ve Sensed (Ibis)
https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/ibis

My Ibis is a list of all the avian species I’ve seen or heard in the wild, in Britain, up to 2012.

It’s currently a single webpage with no interactivity, but I might add more features in the future.
So this is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project rather than a simple HTML document.

Birds from after 2012 or from outside the UK are also listed on the page, though I’ve not integrated them into the main list.

## Astro commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
